    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>My Baked Spaghetti and Meatballs recipe is what I call a magic recipe. It's magic because there is no precooking of ingredients, (not even the dry spaghetti) it all bakes in the oven.</p>
    <p>Warming and hearty, oven-baked spaghetti is a family favourite in the cooler months.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>minced beef
        <li>carrot
        <li> rolled oats
        <li>Italian dried herbs</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>egg</li>
        <li>diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>spaghetti</li>
        <li>beef stock</li>
        <li>passata (tomato pur√©e)</li>
        <li>baby spinach leaves</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Mix eggs and bread crumbs together in a bowl. Add ground beef. Add 1/2 of the oregano, garlic powder, black pepper, and basil. Mix well. Shape into meatballs that are about 1 inch in diameter.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a skillet over medium-low heat. Cook meatballs in the pan with onion until golden brown, 7 to 10 minutes. Add tomato sauce, tomato paste, mushrooms, and remaining oregano, garlic powder, black pepper, and basil. Simmer for about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain.</li>
        <li>Place spaghetti into a 9x13-inch baking pan and pour sauce evenly over the top. Top with Parmesan cheese and cover with aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly and and cheese is melted, about 30 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
